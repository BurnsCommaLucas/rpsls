This project uses the `flask` and `flask_restful` packages to operate a basic web api which can play the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock"

## Setup

This api is built in `python3` with the python package manager `pip`, so you'll need both installed to run this.<br />
From a terminal, navigate to the `web_server` directory and run 
### `pip install -r requirements.txt`

to have pip retrieve the appropriate versions of `flask`, `flask_restful`, and their dependencies.

## Run

To start the api, from the `web_server` directory run a terminal with command 

### `python server.py`
