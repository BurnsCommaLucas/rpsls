# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

The goal of this project was to create a simple but complete web app (user interface and functional api) to play the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock". My solution allows the player their choice of the 5 options against a random computer player, as well as their own randomly chosen option to play. 

The solution I went with uses a `python`/`flask` api which handles the computer player as well as the win/lose conditions, and a rudimentary `react` front end which displays the game and game state to the player. I was able to give this task about 1-2 hours of my time per day for the last 5 days, and this was my second time using each of `flask` and `react`. I also attempted to create a docker image of my api, but I found that the computer I am using does not support virtualization (required for docker).

Each of the sub-projects in this repository have their own `README` showing how to run them.
